# cat-hunt

The original final project game I put together, forced features to make project requirements and all.

You play yourself, looking around in the basement after the lights have gone out and your mother's precious cat has escaped down into the
basement. You have to find it before your mother finds out that you lost poor, poor Mittens, but first you have to find the closet on the
east side of the room to get her carrier out, and of course, you don't want to make any noise to get her attention.

Player = P
TV = @
Antique Vase = V
Chair = h

Movement is in the four cardinal directions and selected by entering 1 for North, 2 for East, 3 for South, and 4 for West. Oh, and you
have 25 minutes (turns) to find the carrier and the cat, and make your way to the stairs at the west end of the basement! Good luck!

Originally, there would be no visual map and everything would be done via text cues triggered by being in an adjacent square to a cat,
obstacle, or stairs, but the project requirements stated a visual element, so here we go.
